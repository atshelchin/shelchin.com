## Who I Am

Hey, I'm Shelchin 👋

I've spent years building apps.

It works. It pays the bills. But something's missing.

I want to build things that create joy, not just utility.

So I'm expanding: Apps + Games.

This is where I document the journey.

## What I'm Thinking About

🎮 Game Design — What makes games fun?

🤖 AI + Game Dev — Can AI tools (Claude, Suno, Midjourney) accelerate game
development?

📊 The Business — Can indie games still be profitable in 2026?

## What I'm Building Now

🔒 Ethereum Wallet — Built on Safe Smart Account with Apple Secure Enclave

🧠 Knowledge Cards — Spaced repetition learning in spare moments

## Next

An indie game. Built with AI. Documented from day one.
