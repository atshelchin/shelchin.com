Hey, I'm Shelchin 👋

I've spent years building apps.

It works. It pays the bills. But something's missing.

I want to build things that create joy, not just utility.

So I'm making a transition: from apps to indie games.


## What I'm Thinking About

🎮 **Game Design** — What makes games fun?

🤖 **AI + Game Dev** — Can AI tools (Claude, Cursor, Suno, Midjourney) actually accelerate solo game development?

🧠 **The Transition** — How does an app developer learn to think like a game designer?

📊 **The Business** — Can indie games still be profitable in 2026? What does the data say?



## What I'm Building Now

🔒 **Ethereum Wallet** — Built on Safe Smart Account with Apple Secure Enclave

🧠 **Knowledge Cards** — Spaced repetition learning in spare moments

🎮 **[Next]** — An indie game. Coming soon. Follow along to see it happen.


## Follow Along

Let's see where this goes.
