Hey, I'm Shelchin 👋

I've spent years building apps — solving problems, shipping features, chasing product-market fit.

It works. It pays the bills. But something's missing.

I want to build things that create joy, not just utility.

So I'm making a transition: from apps to indie games.


## Why Document This?

Because I haven't figured it out yet.

I don't have a game to show you. I don't have revenue numbers. I don't have a success story.

What I have:
- Years of shipping software
- Deep experience with AI tools
- A systematic approach to learning
- The audacity to try something new

This blog is where I'll share the journey — the research, the experiments, the first prototypes, the inevitable failures.


## What I'm Thinking About

🎮 **Game Design** — What makes games fun?

🤖 **AI + Game Dev** — Can AI tools (Claude, Cursor, Suno, Midjourney) actually accelerate solo game development?

🧠 **The Transition** — How does an app developer learn to think like a game designer?

📊 **The Business** — Can indie games still be profitable in 2026? What does the data say?


## Current Status

📍 **Phase: Research & Preparation**

- Studying successful indie games
- Learning Godot
- Experimenting with AI workflows
- Building in public (you're here)

**Next milestone:** First playable prototype


## What I'm Building Now

While preparing the transition, I'm still shipping apps:

🔒 **Ethereum Wallet** — Built on Safe Smart Account with Apple Secure Enclave

🧠 **Knowledge Cards** — Spaced repetition learning in spare moments

*These keep the lights on while I figure out the game thing.*
